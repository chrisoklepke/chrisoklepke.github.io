description: I recently started a new job. On my first day, the shutdown in Germany was widely happening. Now I'm concerned about my situation. But should I really?

<p>These are tough times. And there are tougher times ahead. Most likely. Heck, I don't know. And clearly, nobody else does.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has a good grip on our society, health system, and economies. I won't go into detail on how our society needs to deal with it, and how essential our behavior in these times is. I can't even speak to these things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I want to talk about feelings—mine in particular. After six months of not working at all (which is a story for another time), I got a new gig at a HubSpot Partner agency. I'm still very hyped about it, but I also joined the team during one of the
  biggest global crises.</p>
<h2>Am I in the Hot Seat?</h2>
<p>Although I'm very privileged with the overall working laws in Germany, I'm worried. It's common to have a six month probation period where both parties can cancel the contract very quickly and with short notice.</p>
<p>That in itself isn't a bad thing. I think it's essential for both parties to give the engagement a test drive. Under normal circumstances, at least.</p>
<p>As with many companies, if money is short and contracts are rare in the upcoming month, we can expect the latest hires will be the first ones to go. I fear I will be the first one to go. We see these effects already.</p>
<p>It's hard to express how I feel these days. Seeing closed restaurants, the distance between people in lines, and rising numbers in the news is crazy.</p>
<p>I'm not scared about the virus itself or that I could be affected. I'm worried about infecting others and, like many, take the necessary actions. But for the first time in my life, I'm concerned about the economy.</p>
<p>I bet there are a lot of people like me who feel a mix of a scare, worry, and anxiety. And yes, I and a lot of others can work from home at a computer, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>But it's hard to do business as usual because it ain't business as usual.</p>
<h2>But let's look at the bigger picture</h2>
<p>As I said, I'm in Germany with a very high standard in working laws were other measures like short-term work could be taken into account before firing people.</p>
<p>I'm not working in one of the most affected industries, either. I'm not running a hotel, event venue, or restaurant. So I can check that box as well.</p>
<p>However, my greatest luck is that I started in an Inbound agency. And inbound is all about building relationships and earn trust. No one in the inbound ecosystem is in there for a quick turn around. They're there for the long term and a sustainable impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's one of the healthiest ways to think about business, marketing, and selling for all people involved, including employees.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to feel in crises</h2>
<p>I'm still kinda worried. And I think it's important not to ignore your feelings. My point is perspective. We need to set things into perspective and rethink our relationship with emotions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it might be annoying to work from home and overwhelming starting a new job, I'm privileged in most ways. So I should be fine. And if not, I will also be fine. I have friends and family that would support me no matter what. And if I lose my job,
  I will find something else. Maybe not within my dream field, but I will find something.</p>
<p>There are far less lucky lines of work, industries, and people that are challenged daily. And I'm sure we all can help another somehow. How? I have no fucking clue yet. This is what we need to figure out together. But thinking about your feelings and
  situation is a start.</p>
