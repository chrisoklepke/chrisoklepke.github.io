It's not about you.

It's not about your company or product.

It's even not about your team.

It's about your **CUSTOMERS** and **AUDIENCE.**

> “MARKETING IS THE GENEROUS ACT OF HELPING SOMEONE SOLVE A PROBLEM. THEIR PROBLEM. MARKETING HELPS OTHERS BECOME WHO THEY SEEK TO BECOME”.

- Seth Godin

Help your audience to solve their problem, even if it means not selling your product... especially if it's not about selling your product.

Get over your ego. Get over yourself. It's not you, your company or your product that's important.

People notice when you care about them more than you care about yourself. And if you mean it, it will come back to you again.
