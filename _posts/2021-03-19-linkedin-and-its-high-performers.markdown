I'm not the biggest fan of Linkedin. I'm not feeling it. As a person who's explaining people, *[Don't make it about yourself](https://chrisoklepke.com/blog/its-not-about-you);* avid Linkedin users are the farthest away from that.

I recently stumbled across a profile in my feed starting with the tagline:

> HIGH PERFORMER AND A LIFELONG LEARNER.

Yeah right! First of all: Wtf does it mean to be a high performer. What makes someone a high performer, and by what standards. Who, for crying out loud, measures my high performyness? Is there a test I can take? Is there a test I can even fail?

When I'm scrolling down my feed, I often get a feeling of discomfort. Everyone is achieving great things. Sharing their stories of how they recently won an award. How they succeeded in the last project. Or how they were so honored to have such exciting discussions on the recent clubhouse THEY hosted with all their white male friends with the same opinions.

But Linkedin profiles are, for the most part, BS.

**Got 500+ contacts?**Please! You don't remember half of them when accepting their outreach three years ago.

You're a digital marketing enthusiast **focusing on content, strategy, growth, SEA, PPC, SEO, PR, ABM, and AI?**You have no idea what the word focus means!

[Anxiety because of social media is at an all-time high](http://linkedin%20and%20its%20high%20performers/). And spoiler alert: Not everyone is a high performer. Nor do we need all of humankind to be high performers.

It's ok to be average. It's ok to just kinda like the job you're doing.

You're not Elon. You don't need to work for Elon as well. Some people want to go to work, feel safe while they're there, be valued for the work they do, and get home to do other stuff. After all, it's an exchange.

I'm not saying don't to be passionate about your job. If you do: Excellent! If not... yeah, try and get there. But don't BS your profile trying to get somewhere in life. We are all just people getting by.

So next time you're sharing something on Linkedin or any other channel, try to be human.

> FOR EVERY SUCCESS STORY, SHARE A FAILURE.FOR EVERY WIN, SHARE A LOSS.FOR EVERY LEARNING, SHARE THE TIMES WHEN YOU DOUBT YOURSELF.

I don't know what a high performer is. I don't know if I'm one, and I don't care. But I know that writing it in your profile doesn't make it any more true.
