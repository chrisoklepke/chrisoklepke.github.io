Hi, I'm Christoph. But please call me Chriso. I'm an inbound marketer, designing user experiences.

I believe there is an honest and genuine way to do business. Where people are valued more than numbers. Where being helpful is the key objective, not selling a product. Where managers recognize there is more to life than work.

That's why I try to solve business problems responsibly. And I'm sure being human and transparent results in better experiences. Not only for the customer. But also for the business itself.

I currently consult and [Avidly Agency](https://www.avidlyagency.com).

If you need a marketing job and want to work remotely, I recommend the site [Conversion Mate](https://conversionmate.de). I'm biased though, because I'm the one building it.

Over the past years, I worked with multiple tech startups in Germany, like [Replex](https://www.replex.io) and [Wundercurves](https://www.wundercurves.de), on their marketing and brand strategies and operations.

I also started coaching entrepreneurs at one of Europe's highest-ranked Accelerators: [SpinLab - The HHL Accelerator](https://www.spinlab.co).

If you'd like to say hi or even talk shop, shoot me an email at [christoph.klepke@hey.com](mailto:christoph.klepke@hey.com?subject=Hello there").
